@inproceedings{Baudry_Aspect_05,
	Abstract = {In aspect-oriented modeling (AOM), a design is presented in terms
	of multiple user-defined views (aspects) and model composition is
	often carried out to obtain a model that provides an integrated view
	of the design. Typically, model composition involves merging two
	or more models to obtain a single model. Model composition and model
	transformations that incorporate new features into a model seem to
	serve the same purpose: In model composition, the new features that
	are to be incorporated into a model are explicitly described by one
	or more source models; in a transformation, the new features are
	implicitly defined in the transformation actions that are carried
	out on the input model. The apparent similarities between model composition
	and model transformations often lead to the following question: Is
	model composition a special type of model transformation?},

	Abstract = {Graph transformation has been widely used for expressing model transformations. Especially transformations of visual models can be naturally formulated by graph transformations, since graphs are well suited to describe the underlying structures of models. Based on a common sample model transformation, four different model transformation approaches are presented which all perform graph transformations. At first, a basic solution is presented and crucial points of model transformations are indicated. Subsequent solutions focus mainly on the indicated problems. Finally, a first comparison of the chosen approaches to model transformation is presented where the main ingredients of each approach are summarized.},

	Abstract = {<p>
	Graph transformation (GT) frequently serves as a precise underlying specification mechanism for model transformations within and between modeling languages. However, composability of graph transformation rules is typically limited to inter-level rule composition (i.e. rules calling other rules). In the current paper, we introduce intra-level composition for GT rules where the left-hand side and right-hand side graphs of GT rules can be composed of stand-alone graph patterns in a fully declarative way. As a result, the specification of complex model transformation problems can be drastically reduced. Our concepts are demonstrated using the transformation language of the VIATRA2 framework.</p>

@conference{Botterweck_HOT_09,
	Abstract = {The complexity of embedded systems can partly be handled by models and domain-specific languages (DSLs) like Matlab/Simulink. If we want to apply such techniques to families of similar systems, we have to describe their variability, i.e., commonalities and differences between the similar systems. Here, approaches from Software Product Lines (SPL) and variability modeling can be helpful. In this paper, we discuss three challenges which arise in this context: (1) We have to integrate mechanisms for describing variability into the DSL. (2) To efficiently derive products, we require techniques and tool-support that allow us to configure a particular product and resolve variability in the DSL. (3) When resolving variability, we have to take into account dependencies between elements, e.g., when removing Simulink blocks we have to remove the signals between these blocks as well. The approach presented here uses higher-order transformations (HOT), which derive the variability mechanisms (as a generated model transformation) from the meta-model of a DSL.
